# Test Porting Analysis: Legacy to New Repository

## Executive Summary

This document maps the functionality implemented in the new `near-treasury` repository against the test suite available in the legacy `neardevhub-treasury-dashboard` repository. It identifies which tests can be ported immediately and which require additional implementation work.

**Legend:**
- ‚úÖ **Ready to Port** - Functionality fully implemented, tests can be ported now
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial Implementation** - Core functionality exists but some features may be missing
- ‚ùå **Not Implemented** - Feature not yet implemented, tests cannot be ported
- üîÑ **Architecture Change** - Feature exists but requires test adaptation due to BOS ‚Üí Next.js migration

## Test Infrastructure Adaptations Required

### 1. URL Structure Changes
**Legacy**: `/${instanceAccount}/widget/app?page=...`
**New**: `/[daoId]/dashboard`, `/[daoId]/payments`, etc.

**Impact**: All navigation and URL assertions need updating

---

### 2. Authentication Flow
**Legacy**: BOS wallet connection
**New**: Next.js with NEAR wallet selector

**Impact**: Authentication setup in tests needs adaptation

---

### 3. Data Mocking Strategy
**Legacy**: RPC mocking for BOS widgets
**New**: Mock both Next.js API routes AND RPC calls

**Impact**: Mock infrastructure needs expansion

---

### 4. Test Configuration
**Legacy**: Multiple test projects (treasury-dashboard, infinex, treasury-testing)
**New**: Single Next.js app, can maintain multiple test projects

**Impact**: Minimal - can keep similar structure

---

### 5. Page Load Detection
**Legacy**: Wait for BOS widget to load and render
**New**: Wait for Next.js page hydration and components

**Impact**: Different selectors and wait conditions

---

---

## Key Recommendations

1. **Start with Phase 1** (13 ready tests) - These are confirmed working and essential
2. **Investigate Settings** - Components exist but workflow unclear, could add 7 more tests
3. **Defer Exchange Tests** - Wait for asset exchange feature implementation
4. **Skip Architecture-Specific Tests** - 14 tests don't apply to Next.js architecture
5. **Adapt, Don't Copy** - Tests need significant adaptation for new architecture
6. **Maintain Test Quality** - Use near-sandbox for integration tests, not just UI tests

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Review this analysis
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Prioritize Phase 1 tests for immediate porting
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è Investigate Settings functionality to clarify test porting feasibility
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Set up test porting workflow and conventions
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è Begin porting tests one feature area at a time
6. ‚è≠Ô∏è Document patterns and learnings as you go
