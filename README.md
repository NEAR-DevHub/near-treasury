# NEAR Treasury

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

This project is a conversion of the [NEAR DevHub Treasury Dashboard](https://github.com/NEAR-DevHub/neardevhub-treasury-dashboard), which was originally built on NEAR BOS (Blockchain Operating System).

While BOS is excellent for serving multiple apps in one web portal, the sandbox environment and isolation enforced by [NEAR Social VM](https://github.com/NearSocial/VM) create development challenges. These restrictions limit access to certain web browser features and APIs that are not available to BOS widgets/components.

We chose to rebuild NEAR Treasury as a standard Next.js React app to accelerate development and unlock the full potential of modern web technologies for an optimal user experience.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
